# What-The-Fit-HW18

#Description:
As a developer in a full-stack bootcamp we were challenged with developing a fitness tracker application that has the abulity to add exercises t a workout plan as well as create new workout plans. With the addition of letting the user track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, then they can measure the distance travelled.
Usage:

#Challenges 
The main challenge of this task was to figure out how the routes operated. This coupled with the fact that I wished to work in a layout that would make the code scalable. I had spent many days trying to develop my own routes but I thought best to reverse-engineer a similar application online on github. Though it would have been preferred I develop my own solution, I am happy to report that I have learned a lot from looking at another developer's approach. At the end of this project I came out a better developer and I hope to code my own version of routes in future.

#Author and Credits:
The code credit goes to Carlos Toledo @github.com/kqarlos,
I simply used his code as a model to learn from, as stated in the challenges, I found this task difficult to execute. So in order to move forward I investigated an application with a similar goal to my own and broke down the code, researching why the authour created their routes in the way they did. I can leave this project as a better developer and hope to return to this repo in future to attempt this task again in a separate way whilst still retaining the functionality of the app.
